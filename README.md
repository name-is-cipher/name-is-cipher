Hi, I’m Aravind Swami, a.k.a name-is-cipher

Before you start to know, there are few points* you might wanna know.
I'm currently a student at [IIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Space_Science_and_Technology), pursuing my engineering in the Avionics field. I live in Vizag, AP, India.
Networking and cybersecurity enthusiast.
Oreo Lover.
Not a coffee man.

*Points to be noted about me:
- I always learn from mistakes of others who take my advice. So my advice is, dont take any advice from me.

And by the way, there is no compulsion to follow me, because I don’t even know where I’m going...  
But you can contact me any time as, I'm always available ->
