Hi, I’m Aravind Swami, a.k.a name-is-cipher

Before you start to know me, there are few points* you might wanna know first.

*Points to be noted about me:
- I always learn from mistakes of others who take my advice. So my advice is, dont take any advice from me.

With that being said lets know about me, I'm currently a student at [IIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Space_Science_and_Technology), pursuing my engineering in the Avionics.   
I live in Vizag, AP, India.  
Networking and cybersecurity enthusiast.  
Oreo Lover.  
Not a coffee man.  

And by the way, there is no compulsion to follow me, because I don’t even know where I’m going...  
But you can contact me any time as, I'm always available ->
