Hi, 
Iâ€™m Aravind Swami [a.k.a C1PH3R]  
  
Before you start to know me, there is one things you might wanna know first.
  
- I always learn from the mistakes of others who take my advice. So my advice is, don't take any advice from me. 
 
So with that being said, now let us really know about me:  
I'm ->  
Networking and Cybersecurity enthusiast.  
Oreo Lover.  
Not really a coffee man, but if like my work you can ðŸ‘‡

And by the way, there is no compulsion to follow me, because even I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going...  
But you can always contact me, as you know I'm always free ->
